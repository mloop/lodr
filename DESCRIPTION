Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kevin Donovan and Matthew Loop

Description: There are many methods and software to handle censored outcome variables. 
However, there are not many software packages to handle censored covariates, which often occur with biomarker values below the limit of detection. 
The lodr package implements and EM-algorithm method to find the regression model that would best fit the full dataset, had it been observed.
